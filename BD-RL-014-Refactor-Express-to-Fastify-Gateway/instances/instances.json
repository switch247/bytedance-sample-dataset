  "instance_id": "BD-RL-014 -Refactor-Express-to-Fastify-Gateway",
  "problem_statement": "The objective is to refactor a monolithic Express.js REST gateway into a production-hardened Fastify implementation. The legacy service currently suffers from high framework overhead, leading to excessive memory consumption and latency spikes on low-spec hardware. The new implementation must leverage Fastify's native optimizations, including AJV-based schema validation and the fast-json-stringify engine, to maximize throughput and achieve a significant increase in requests per second (RPS) while maintaining strict endpoint parity.",
